A very basic 'base' project to test, practice, familiarize and proof-of-concept
of a SQLite3/Sequelize/NodeJS/Express RESTful API featuring authentication and
authorization.

The model is simple as the two basic Classes, User and Role, which serve, both
as example and as Authentication (User) / Authorization (Role) basis.

- Authentication and authorization are performed as a chain of
  middleware filtering processes in router.
- Authentication is based in JWT using jsonwebtoken.
- Models / Persistence is based on Sequelize.
- An open login endpoint provides the JWT generation mechanism.
  User and password credentials are validated against DB.
  User and Role are stored as part of token.
- Middleware athentication validates and decodes token getting
- Middleware authorization compares token role with required Role.
- Routers do chain-use authentication and authorization middleware.
